## Optimizing QDev experiments using AI

### TODO
[ ] Interface code & experiment
[ ] Optimize experiment with standard gradient descent techniques (SciPy)
[ ] Simultaneously train a generative model that predicts staircasiness from (V2, tilt) input tuples
[ ] Use generative model to speed up line search in gradient descent
